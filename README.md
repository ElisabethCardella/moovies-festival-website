The project sponsor Ms. Jennifer Edwards, who is the organizer of the Les Films de Plein Air festival, expressed the following needs:

Communicate online about her festival
Advertise the films screened
Collect reservations to estimate the number of participants
Create a graphic charter
Have a professional address (in .com or .org)
Not having to choose and manage accommodation
The objective of the project is to allow the association to communicate about the festival and promote author films while having visibility on the number of participants through an online pre-registration system.
